What is the purpose and difference in public, private and protected access specifiers. Illustrate a design example with this.

Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.
Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
