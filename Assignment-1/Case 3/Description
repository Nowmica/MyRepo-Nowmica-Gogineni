Variable Scope:- Scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible.
Java programs are organized in the form of classes. Every class is part of some package.
Java scope rules can be covered under following categories.

Member Variables (Class Level Scope):

These variables must be declared inside class (outside any function). 
They can be directly accessed anywhere in class.
Member variables can be accessed outside a class with the help of access specifiers.

Local Variables (Method Level Scope):
Variables declared inside a method have method level scope and can’t be accessed outside the method.
